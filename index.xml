      <description>MacAdminFi is an organization of Finnish Mac Admininistrators. Our aim is to provide information and (moral) support, and organize events, revolving around the Apple ecosystems.
We have no official structure, membership or affiliation with any instances. Individually, we exist in Finnish organisations and companies, taking care of Macs and their users. Collectively, we (sometimes) exist on the #finland MacAdmins Slack channel, taking care of each other.
Every so often, we have an actual gathering, a mini-conference of sorts.</description>

      <description>Hello Suomalaiset people and others too! Welcome to the new and first home of the Finnish Mac Admin community. These webpages will host information about coming events and occasionally a blog post or two. The best thing is that anybody can take part and contribute - our source code is open on GitHub.
Our small community has been growing rapidly during the past year - so at least for us, 2016 was not that bad afterall.</description>
